# Review of Python Solution

Excellent work so far! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  
You have done a great job creating an algorithm that groups the anagrams together from an array of strings strs as per project requirements.🥳  
There are a few issues that you still need to work on to improve your solution. You are almost there! 💪🏾 

<br>

## Highlights 🌞 
<hr>

Overall, this is a good solution that solves the problem correctly and efficiently. However, there are some minor bugs, optimizations, style improvements, and documentation enhancements that can be made to make it even better. I hope this feedback helps you improve your Python skills and coding practices. Keep up the good work! 😊

## Required Changes ♻️
<hr>

### Correctness
> The solution is **correct** and passes the given test case. It correctly groups the anagrams together by sorting each string and using it as a key in a dictionary.

- However, there is a bug in `line 5: x = "".join(sorted())`. The sorted function should take `i` as an argument, otherwise, it will raise a [TypeError](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/typeerror-in-python#:~:text=TypeError%20is%20an%20exception%20in,object%20will%20not%20be%20compatible.). The correct code should be: `x = "".join(sorted(i))`.

<br>

### Efficiency
- The solution has a [time complexity](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/why-is-time-complexity-essential/#:~:text=Time%20complexity%20is%20defined%20as,of%20code%20in%20an%20algorithm.) of O(NKlogK), where N is the number of strings and K is the maximum length of any string. This is because, for each string, we sort it in O(KlogK) time and then insert it into the dictionary in O(1) time.
- The solution has a [space complexity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/) of O(NK), where N is the number of strings and K is the maximum length of any string. This is because we store all the strings in the dictionary, which can have at most N entries with K characters each.
- The solution can be **optimized** by using a different hash function for the anagrams instead of sorting them. For example, we can count the frequency of each letter in each string and use that as a tuple key for the dictionary. This would reduce the time complexity to O(NK) and the space complexity to O(N).

<br>

### Style

> The solution follows **PEP 8**, which is the official style guide for Python code. It uses consistent indentation, spaces around operators and commas, and descriptive variable names.

- However, there are some minor improvements that can be made to enhance readability and consistency:
  - Add a docstring to the class and the method to explain what they do and what parameters they take.
  - Add comments to explain the logic behind each step of the algorithm.
  - Use linter checks like `Pylint` to check for Python best practices, the indentation and naming style can be improved.

<br>

### Documentation

> The solution includes a test case with an example input and output. This helps to verify that the solution works as expected and to illustrate how it can be used. Well done!!!. 💯 🎊 🥳

- However, there are some additional steps that can be taken to improve documentation:
  - Add more test cases with different inputs (e.g., empty list, single string, duplicate strings) and expected outputs.
  - Use docstrings or comments to explain what each test case does and why it is important.
