# HyperionDev Freelance Code Reviewer Take-Home Test

## Sections Covered

This document highlights the options that I picked for this assignment.

## Section A: Code Review

This section simulates a typical interaction that you might have with
a student. You will be given a question that a hypothetical student
asks and the student’s submitted code. You will be required to answer 
the question and review their code’s correctness, efficiency, style and
documentation.

### Option 1: Python Task

- A anagram.py file is present
- Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. 

Code Review: [Preview](./Section A/Option 1: Python Task/Review.md)

### Option 3: Ruby Task

- A palindrome.rb file is present
- An algorithm to determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backwards and forwards.
